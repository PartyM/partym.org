PartyM’s ideology is both simple and complicated:
 
**Strive to be the voice of integrity, moderation and new ideas in our country.**
 
At a high level, the ideology breaks down as follows:
 
1. Our diversity and culture should be representative of the Unites States.
* Do not take a pre-disposed position where sufficient information is available to guide us.
* Tend to lean [right](https://wikipedia.com/republican) on fiscal issues.
* Tend to lean [left](https://wikipedia.com/democrat) on social progress.
* Think [libertarian](https://wikipedia.com/libertarian) to control size and efficiency of the government.
* Where no great option exists, forego the above and come up with our own position.
* Positions may change over time as information evolves. **This is a good thing.**
 
### In Practice
 
#### Diversity

The 115th Congress has record number of women but this congress is still not representative of United States diversity when it comes to race or gender. Democrats are generally more diverse and Republicans tend to be older, white males [1].

PartyM should strive to enlist the help and support of all those that make up our great, mixed country. We're strong believers that everyone has a unique perspective to bring to the political discourse. We want to recruit all races, male and female, young and old, religious and not, rich and poor, tall and short, military and civilian, etc.

We can move past the white/black/hispanic christian/catholic vote and appeal to not only these groups but all those who are not currently represented.
 
#### Predisposition
 
The major parties take pre-dispositions on any topic and generally it's opposite one another. This is a terrible stance for any real reforms.

We strive to eliminate predispositions and leverage information to make an informed policy.
 
#### Leanings
 
**Right** - For fiscal issues we tend to believe that a balanced budget is a good thing but debt is okay in the right circumstances. We believe that citizens shouldn't be overly burdened when paying the government. We believe in a free market but understand the some regulation may be needed, particularly when industries can't control themselves.
 
**Left** - Social progress is an unstoppable force and fighting it is a losing battle. This doesn't mean we believe in all social programs, particularly if the budget isn't balanced but there are some core themes such as education and equality that we believe strongly in.
 
**Libertarian** - We believe that the private sector is better and more efficient at performing a task compared to the government. We should reduce government bloat where possible and attempt to offload work to non-profits/private organizations when possible.
 
**Down the Middle** a.k.a "our own path" - In many situations we'll come up with our own approach to a problem which may not fall into any of the above sides.
 
#### Moving Targets
 
Issues are taken at face value, researched, presented, and feedback requested from the public prior to choosing a position. Stances will change overtime as the environment (political, economic, etc) changes. These changes should be expected, encouraged, documented and communicated clearly.

As part of the research phase, we would like to see more experimentation from government prior to making laws.
 
### Why
 
We’ve been repeatedly disappointed with our current choices of political parties and leaders in the United States. The 2 major parties are at each other’s throats and we’re exceedingly polarized as a nation. We need a party to be the voice of reason in the middle who is willing to work with both sides to get things done.
 
There is evidence that a majority of americans don’t completely identify with either party and are much more moderate than is shown in the news[2]. We aim to empower this group.
 
### Core Values
 
* Honor and Integrity
* Respect
* Transparency
* Data and decisions should be open and transparent.
* Like time, we can only ever move forward. We should learn from the past both positively and negatively. We strive to not undo or reimplement the past but make things better for the future.
 
### Role of the Federal Government
 
* To protect it’s citizens.
* To enable a high quality of life for it’s citizens.
* To invest in the future.

### One size does not fit all

One size doesn't fit all; The differences between the poor, middle class and rich are drastic and we should take this into account when designing policy.
